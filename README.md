Here you can find some of my kaggle notebooks. There are following folders:
- data_analysis folder: These notebooks are fully implemented from scratch. Public datasets are used from kaggle. The goal is to create a visually representative notebook with a meaningful conclusion.
- machine_learning folder: These notebooks are parts of my work in machine learning competitions. This folder includes comlicated works. Some of them created from scratch, while some others are work on top of other public notebooks.
